About Codeable Models
*********************

Codeable Models aims to provide an easy-to-use API for coding software design models
akin to UML models, but radically simplified compared to the UML2 meta-model. That is,
the API allows you to create metaclasses, classes, objects, stereotypes and their
dependencies.

Typical use case for Codeable Models are:

- Create models textually and be able to use textual tools such as search & replace, copy & paste, grep,
  and so on to edit them.
- Ease model creation and manipulation through code - provided in Python scripts with little to no boilerplate code.
- Using Python code to ensure model consistency, perform constraint checking, perform analyses, and calculate metrics.
- Create domain models in your code and use them at runtime in your Python project, e.g. to realize a
  portion of the software system to reflect the domain model in a very literal way
  as envisaged in Domain-driven Design (DDD).
- Generate visual representations of those models such as  UML diagrams and tables,
  e.g. used to support understanding the big picture and communicating the model.
- Generate other textual representations, such as Markdown or Latex texts.
- Generate code and/or configuration scripts from the models.
